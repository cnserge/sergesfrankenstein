Shelley (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of Frankenstein. The draft in c.56 runs from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is about to begin his tale to Victor.</p>

        <p>
          It was on a dreary night of November<lb/>
          that I beheld

          with an anxiety that almost amount<lb/>
          ed to agony I collected instruments of life<lb/>
          around me <del hand="#MWS" type="crossedOut">and endeavour to</del>
          <add hand="#MWS" place="supralinear">that I might</add>

          spark of being into the lifeless thin

          that lay at my feet. It was already<lb/>
          one in the morning, the rain pattered<lb/>
          dismally against the window panes, &amp;<lb/>
          my candle was nearly burnt out, when<lb/>
          by the glimmer of the half extinguish<lb/>
          ed light I saw the dull yellow eye of<lb/>
          the creature open—It breathed hard,<lb/>
          and a convulsive motion agitated<lb/>
          its limbs.

          <del hand="#MWS" type="crossedOut">But How</del>  can I describe my<lb/>

          infinite pains and care I had endeavoured<lb/>
          to form. His limbs were in proportion<lb/>
